# Range Asymmetric Numeral Systems (rANS) Decoder

## Project Description

This project implements a Range Asymmetric Numeral Systems (rANS) decoder in C++. rANS is a form of entropy encoding used for efficient data compression, particularly well-suited for applications where compression efficiency and speed are critical. This repository provides the foundational code and necessary instructions for building the decoder.

## Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have `g++` installed (preferably supporting C++17).
- **Make**: This project uses `make` for build automation.

## Project Structure

- **Makefile**: Automates the build process.
- **app/**: Contains `main.cpp`, which includes the main logic of the rANS decoder.
- **lib/**: Placeholder for any additional libraries (add required files if necessary).
- **utils/**: Placeholder for utility files (add required files if necessary).

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codercoder1709/RangeANS.git
   cd RangeANS
2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
3. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
